  Our project is a simulated brokerage where a user can deposit money into their account, access 
  data on S&P 500 stocks and add them to their portfolio. They can buy and sell these stocks,
  or even view options pricing. Clients can always see a history of transactions and determine
  how much money they have made.

  A standard command-line I/O user interface is supported.
